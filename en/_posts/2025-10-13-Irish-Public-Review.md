We're pleased to announce that the public review process for the **Irish translation of the Rights Statement** is closed and the [Irish translation](https://rightsstatements.org/page/1.0/?language=ga) is now available.

We extend our sincere gratitude to the National Library of Ireland as the primary translation partner. A special acknowledgement to **Lauren Ní Fhloinn** and **Dr. Johanna Archbold** for their time and expertise as reviewers. 
We'd also like to thank everyone else who contributed to these translations, through the development of them or the public consultation.
